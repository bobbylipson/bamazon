# bamazon

How it works:

Bamazon is an online store made using SQL that when run shows the inventory of store consisting of 10 items. The programs prompts the customer by asking 'What would you like to purchase?' The customer types in the product name. The program then asks the customer 'How many would you like to buy?' Once the order is made the inventory is then reduced by that numnber and reprinted on the screen to show the updated count. The user can exit the program by hitting Q then enter.
